<h2>Extract truss data</h2>
<p>Use your favorite drafting software to visulally prepare the data. Create a layer named <b>nodes</b>. On this layer, mark the position of the nodes with a simple text entry. The insertion point of the text has to be identical with exact location of the node. Draw the middle axes of the rods on layer <b>rods</b>. The endpoints of each rod have to fit to one of the nodes. That means even long straight rods have to be interrupted at nodes.</p>
